        <h3>About me</h3>
           <p> 
            My name is Pavel and I am coder in the making. <br><br>
            In past 5 years, I have been building my career in sales. My experience is based on meeting customers, working on multiple different projects at the same time with aim to secure new business.
            With most of the job role being face-2-face meetings, I would say that I am comfortable in making eye contact, presenting and looking for solutions. <br>
            Although my current position gives me a lot of freedom, lets me organize my time schedule and puts me in front of interesting people, I feel a need for change. I feel like coding might be it. <br><br>
            I chose Codecademy as a place to start and get new insight in what could possibly be my next life/career path. I am currently going through Full Stack Engineer course, even though I feel that later I would feel better working with large data and analytics.
            <br>
            However, I am now focused on finishing what I have started and getting my certificate from this course. This portfolio page is one step closer (since it is a project within the course). <br><br>

            Feel free to browse through my other projects. <br>
            Should you have any question or feedback or maybe just want to get in touch to talk about coding, switching careers or any other topics, you are more than welcome to reach out. I promise to respond and I am eager to hear from you.
            <br><br>
            <br>
            Thank you for visiting!
